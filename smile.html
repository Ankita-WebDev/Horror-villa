      <h1>SMILE</h1>

      <p>
        At a psychiatric ward in Newark, New Jersey, therapist Rose Cotter meets
        graduate student Laura Weaver,[a] who explains that she recently
        witnessed her professor kill himself. Laura claims to be terrorized by
        an invisible Entity that appears as various smiling people and has
        foretold her death. She begins screaming and choking, prompting Rose to
        call for help; Laura suddenly calms down and smiles uncannily, then
        fatally slits her own throat, terrifying Rose.
      </p>
      <p>The next day, Rose sees a patient named Carl, who smiles in the same way and tells her that she is going to die. Rose calls for nurses to restrain Carl, only to realize Carl has been asleep the entire time. Concerned for Rose's mental well-being, her supervisor, Morgan, orders Rose to take a week off. Rose's hallucinations continue, leading those around her to believe she may be a danger to herself. Rose visits her former therapist Madeline, who suggests that Rose's problems stem from her childhood, in which she witnessed her abusive and mentally ill mother die from overdose.</p>
      <p>Rose sees a toy train and buys it as a birthday present for her nephew, Jackson, the son of her older sister, Holly. At the party, he unwraps her present to find the corpse of Mustache, Rose's cat, horrifying everyone. Rose has a public breakdown and sees a guest smiling unnaturally at her, causing her to fall into a glass coffee table and injure herself. This convinces Rose that she has fallen victim to a curse, although her fianc√© Trevor believes she has gone crazy.</p>
      <p>Upon learning that Laura's professor was smiling at her before his death, Rose visits the professor's widow, Victoria, and learns that he had also witnessed a suicide shortly before his own. Rose asks her ex-boyfriend Joel, a police detective, to review old police records. They find several cases of people who witnessed someone commit suicide while smiling at them before doing the same to themselves within a week</p>
      <p>Rose tries to patch things up with Trevor but realizes he has called on Madeline for psychological intervention without asking her first. Upset, she leaves to speak with Holly, who also dismisses Rose's belief in a curse. Holly compares Rose's behavior to their late mother, and Rose accuses Holly of abandoning her before their mother's death.</p>
      <p>Rose and Joel discover the sole exception in the chain of suicides: convicted murderer Robert Talley. Rose and Joel visit him in prison, where he claims that the Entity feeds on trauma and that the only way to escape it is to brutally kill someone else in front of a witness to traumatize them, passing the curse to the witness. Rose angrily rejects this idea, after which a terrified Robert yells at her to leave when he realizes that Rose is the one who is cursed. Later, Madeline visits Rose for a therapy session, only to reveal herself as the Entity in disguise when the real Madeline calls. Rose drives to her hospital with a knife and murders Carl in front of Morgan, but this is revealed to be a hallucination. Rose wakes up in her car to find Morgan standing outside. He notices the knife, but she speeds away, prompting him to alert the police. </p>
